This mod is a patch for the Rimhammer - The End Times - Magic mod. 

It makes the magic available to any pawn in the game. So pawns of any race or faction will have a chance to end up with a trait that grants them magic. 

This can safely be added to an ongoing game.

You can use just the Rimhammer - The End Times Magic mod and this mod out of the Rimhammer mod series, and have Rimhammer magic user pawns in any game. 

Load this after the Rimhammer - The End Times - Magic mod.

If you'd like to speed up the process of release, please consider supporting me on Patreon. The more support I get, the more motivated I will be to create more races/factions. https://www.patreon.com/SickBoyWI
